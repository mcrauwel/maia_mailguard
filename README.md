This is a fork of Maia mailguard.

The original license has been replaced with a GPL license with the blessing of the project's original creator. See license.txt for further information.

This fork brings the project in line with current deployments and technology, such as newer versions of PHP.

Some features are known to be untested and probably broken, such as authentication mechanisms other than "internal".

There are some new requirements on PHP modules, these are easiest identified by running the standard configtest.php.


# Status

This fork was created to resolve specific issues and for the purpose of providing the community a place to send patches when the mainline was unresponsive.

I am happy to assist with ongoing merging however please note there is no intent in writing new features for this application.
